        <br /><b>cole nugteren is a designer, programmer, and environment + technical artist making deliberate and intimate video games in minneapolis.</b><br /><br />

        <br />a lifelong multihyphenate, he believes that to author something is to know it fully, so he has trained both in art and design and in computer science. he’s been making video games since he was ten years old. <br />

        <br />in addition to games, cole makes lots of digital art, draws made-up places, writes music, and tells stories. he is fascinated by atmosphere and tone, and his work is largely an exploration of how systems and spaces make people feel. it strives to be more intentional than natural, more expressive than immersive, and more curious than familiar. <br />

        <br />cole believes that making art is a social act, even when you are doing it alone. he’s worked as a solo developer, a member and leader of many development teams, and a game design educator. he makes games for and with others in the same way that he plays them to know others more deeply. cole loves to meet new people, to work with them, to teach them and to learn from them. he hopes to continue making things with as many passionate and interesting people as possible. <br />

        <br />if they make video games illegal, he will become a designer of mini golf courses or maybe kitsch novelty themed restaurants. <br />
